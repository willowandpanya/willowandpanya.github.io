The inspiration for Willow and Panya Botanicals came from a multitude of little moments leading up to one particular trip to the market. We had already been buying natural and organic products for ourselves, but once I became pregnant I began scrutinizing every single ingredient on every product I put on my skin, and I was stunned. I found that even products labeled "all natural" and that were sold in health food stores had a lot of ingredients that I did not like; phylates, parabens, parfumes, fragrances, hormone disrupters, preservatives. I found many of these to be at worst potentially harmful, and at best unnecessary.
I then did the research and used my background in cosmetology to create my own products. After sharing them with friends and family it seemed obvious to share them with the world, and thus Willow and Panya Botanicals was born, out of my own necessity, and pure passion.
